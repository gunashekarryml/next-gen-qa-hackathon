🧠 Team2 QA Hackathon – Smart QA Intelligence Platform

Welcome to the Team2 QA Intelligence Platform, an automated system that:
• Executes automation tests using Playwright
• Generates enriched test result insights
• Visualizes trends with a React Triage Dashboard
• Sends Slack & Email notifications
• Auto-deploys dashboard via GitHub Pages

Perfect for accelerating root cause analysis, reducing triage time, and delivering smarter CI/CD pipelines.
